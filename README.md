##Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning
Project Description: This project involves processing, visualising, and modelling accelerometer and gyroscope data from a sensor to create a machine learning model that can classify weightlifiting exercises. 



#Key Features:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values and performed feature engineering to improve model performance.
- Model Selection and Training: Compared several regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the Random Forest model.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated the models using various metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
- Visualization: Created visualizations to show the distribution of house prices, feature importance, and model performance.

#Challenges and Learnings:

- Learned how to handle categorical data and scale numerical features.
Understood the importance of feature selection and its impact on model performance.
- Gained experience with hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Source and Inspiration:

#Future Work:

- Plan to deploy the model as a web application using Flask.
- Explore more advanced techniques like XGBoost and neural networks for improved performance.
